function [reconstructed] = fft_filter(data,dimension,bandlimits)
%The filter is designed to filter gridded data in an array of up to 5 dimensions (DATA)
%with the filtering done only in the dimension specified by DIMENSION.
%The signal in data is first decomposed in the frequency domain (amplitude vs frequency).
%Then the amplitudes associated with frequencies outside of the BANDLIMITS are set to zero.
%Then an inverse Fourier transform is performed resulting in the reconstructed signal.
 
% DATA : array to filter of up to 5 dimensions, the dimension to filter must be evenly spaced and be a multiple of 2.
% if the dimension is spaced unevenly, interpolation to regular interval is advised.
% DIMENSION : 1 integer indication the dimension to filter
% BANDLIMITS : 2 numbers indicating the boundary of the selected frequency band. The bandlimit is actually
% expressed as the period. Bandlimits have the same unit as the spacing between measurements
% ex: if filtering with measurements every day, bandlimit of [5 10] means only oscillation with periods
% of 5 to 10 days are kept in the signal. To construct a low-pass or high-pass, on can use [5 Inf] or [0 5]
% RECONSTRUCTED : array of same size as data containing the filtered signal.
 
% ATTENTION : Fourier transform are accurate for periodic signals. If the filtered values are not periodic,
% it is advised to make them periodic. Ex signal= 1 2 5 coult be modified to 1 2 5 5 2 1 for periodicity.
% Only the first half of reconstructed should be used in this case.
